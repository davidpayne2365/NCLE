        ],
        answer: 3,
        explanation: "Rotational stability is the primary consideration when fitting toric soft contact lenses. Since toric lenses correct astigmatism, the lens must maintain proper orientation to align the cylindrical correction with the patient's astigmatic axis. Various stabilization methods (prism ballast, peri-ballast, dual thin zones) help achieve this stability."
    },
    {
        question: "What is a characteristic of a loose-fitting soft lens?",
        options: [

            "Evaluate lens centration, movement, and visual performance at multiple distances"
        ],
        answer: 3,
        explanation: "The best way to evaluate the fit of a multifocal soft contact lens is to assess lens centration, movement, and visual performance at multiple distances. Proper centration is critical for simultaneous vision designs, as decentration can significantly affect the balance between distance and near vision."
    },
    {
        question: "If a soft contact lens has edge lift when observed on the cornea, how can this be corrected?",
        options: [
            "Steepen the base curve",
            "Decrease the diameter",
            "Flatten the base curve",
            "Change the edge design"
        ],
        answer: 0,
        explanation: "If a soft contact lens has edge lift (the edge is not conforming to the ocular surface), this can be corrected by steepening the base curve. A steeper base curve creates a tighter fit that allows the lens to better drape over the cornea and align with the sclera at the edges."
    },

            "Feel the edge thickness"
        ],
        answer: 0,
        explanation: "The correct way to verify the orientation of a soft contact lens before insertion is to place it on a fingertip and look at its profile. A properly oriented lens will have edges that turn slightly upward, resembling a bowl. An inside-out lens will have edges that flare outward and may appear more flat or irregularly shaped."

            "Recommend more frequent replacement"
        ],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "A patient with a tight-fitting soft contact lens should be refitted with a flatter base curve or different lens material with better oxygen permeability. Tight lenses restrict movement and tear exchange, which can lead to corneal hypoxia, neovascularization, and discomfort. Different materials may also reduce binding or adherence to the cornea."

        ],
        answer: 3,
        explanation: "When keratometry mires reflected off a soft contact lens are only clear immediately after a blink, it indicates a flat-fitting lens. The lens moves excessively and settles into a more stable position only momentarily after a blink, causing distortion of the mires between blinks."

        ],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "If a toric lens rotates 10 degrees clockwise (to the right), the ordered lens axis should be adjusted 10 degrees counterclockwise from the desired axis. In this case, to achieve an axis of 180 in situ, the ordered lens should have an axis of 170 degrees. This follows the LARS principle (Left Add, Right Subtract)."

        ],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "A back toric soft lens works best with high corneal toricity. The toric back surface of the lens aligns with the toric corneal surface, providing better centration and stability, especially when the corneal astigmatism is significant (generally > 2.00D)."

        ],
        answer: 3,
        explanation: "Rotational stability is the primary consideration when fitting toric soft contact lenses. Since toric lenses correct astigmatism, the lens must maintain proper orientation to align the cylindrical correction with the patient's astigmatic axis. Various stabilization methods (prism ballast, peri-ballast, dual thin zones) help achieve this stability."

        ],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Diffuse central punctate staining is typically an indication of a tight-fitting lens. A tight lens restricts tear exchange and oxygen transmission, leading to epithelial compromise, particularly in the central cornea where the lens has the most contact."

        ],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Corneal edema observed inferiorly under a prism ballast toric soft lens is likely caused by the prism thickness being too great. The thicker portion of the lens (the prism ballast) restricts oxygen transmission to that area of the cornea, potentially causing localized hypoxia and edema."

        explanation: "A rigid lens that shows two base curves on the radiuscope but displays a spherical power on the lensometer indicates a warped lens. In a properly manufactured lens, specific designs should show predictable patterns: spherical lenses show one base curve and spherical power; back toric lenses show two base curves and toroidal power; front toric lenses show one base curve and toroidal power."

        question: "Which lens design would be most appropriate for a patient with keratoconus?",
        options: [
            "Standard alignment fitting RGP",
            "Soper or Rose K design",
            "Aspheric soft lens",
            "Standard toric soft lens"
        ],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Specialty designs like Soper or Rose K are most appropriate for patients with keratoconus. These designs feature steeper central curves to vault over the cone with flatter peripheral curves to align with the normal peripheral cornea, providing better centration, stability, and vision than standard design lenses."

        question: "For a patient who has undergone penetrating keratoplasty (corneal transplant), what fitting approach is typically most effective?",
        options: [
            "Standard soft lens fitting",
            "Toric soft lens fitting",
            "Diagnostic RGP fitting with fluorescein assessment",
            "Empirical fitting based on keratometry readings"
        ],
        answer: 2,
        explanation: "For post-penetrating keratoplasty patients, a diagnostic RGP fitting with fluorescein assessment is typically most effective. The transplanted cornea often has irregular astigmatism and elevation disparities at the graft-host junction that require direct evaluation with trial lenses rather than relying solely on keratometry readings or empirical formulas."

        question: "According to FDA regulations, what risk category are contact lenses classified under?",
        options: [
            "Class I (low risk)",
            "Class II (moderate risk)",
            "Class III (high risk)",
            "Over-the-counter devices"
        ],
        answer: 2,
        explanation: "According to FDA regulations, contact lenses are classified as Class III (high risk) medical devices. This classification applies to all contact lenses, including plano (non-prescription) cosmetic lenses, due to their direct contact with the eye and potential for serious complications if improperly fitted or used."

        question: "What is the maximum expiration period for a contact lens prescription under the Fairness to Contact Lens Consumers Act (FCLCA)?",
        options: [
            "6 months",
            "1 year",
            "2 years",

        ],
        answer: 3,
        explanation: "The maximum expiration period for a contact lens prescription varies by state law under the Fairness to Contact Lens Consumers Act (FCLCA). While the FCLCA requires prescribers to provide patients with their prescriptions, it defers to state laws regarding expiration dates, which typically range from 1-2 years."

        question: "What is the best way to evaluate the fit of a multifocal soft contact lens?",
        options: [
            "Assess lens movement only",
            "Check distance vision only",
            "Check near vision only",
            "Evaluate lens centration, movement, and visual performance at multiple distances"
        ],
        answer: 3,
        explanation: "The best way to evaluate the fit of a multifocal soft contact lens is to assess lens centration, movement, and visual performance at multiple distances. Proper centration is critical for simultaneous vision designs, as decentration can significantly affect the balance between distance and near vision."
