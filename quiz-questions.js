        explanation: "Rotational stability is the primary consideration when fitting toric soft contact lenses. Since toric lenses correct astigmatism, the lens must maintain proper orientation to align the cylindrical correction with the patient's astigmatic axis. Various stabilization methods (prism ballast, peri-ballast, dual thin zones) help achieve this stability."
    },
    {
        question: "What is a characteristic of a loose-fitting soft lens?",

            "Decrease the diameter",
            "Flatten the base curve",
            "Change the edge design"
        ],
        answer: 0,
        explanation: "If a soft contact lens has edge lift (the edge is not conforming to the ocular surface), this can be corrected by steepening the base curve. A steeper base curve creates a tighter fit that allows the lens to better drape over the cornea and align with the sclera at the edges."
    },

            "Recommend more frequent replacement"
        ],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "A patient with a tight-fitting soft contact lens should be refitted with a flatter base curve or different lens material with better oxygen permeability. Tight lenses restrict movement and tear exchange, which can lead to corneal hypoxia, neovascularization, and discomfort. Different materials may also reduce binding or adherence to the cornea."

        ],
        answer: 3,
        explanation: "Rotational stability is the primary consideration when fitting toric soft contact lenses. Since toric lenses correct astigmatism, the lens must maintain proper orientation to align the cylindrical correction with the patient's astigmatic axis. Various stabilization methods (prism ballast, peri-ballast, dual thin zones) help achieve this stability."

        ],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Diffuse central punctate staining is typically an indication of a tight-fitting lens. A tight lens restricts tear exchange and oxygen transmission, leading to epithelial compromise, particularly in the central cornea where the lens has the most contact."

        ],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "Corneal edema observed inferiorly under a prism ballast toric soft lens is likely caused by the prism thickness being too great. The thicker portion of the lens (the prism ballast) restricts oxygen transmission to that area of the cornea, potentially causing localized hypoxia and edema."

        explanation: "Contact lenses are labeled by their back vertex power, which is the power as measured at the back surface of the lens. The back vertex power represents the effective focusing power when the lens is on the eye. Using back vertex power ensures that the lens provides the correct refractive effect at the cornea. Front vertex or 'in situ' power are not used in specifying lens prescriptions because they do not directly correspond to the lensâs effect on the eye."

        answer: 2,
        explanation: "For higher prescriptions (generally above 4.00 D), a vertex distance adjustment is needed. A -5.00 D spectacle lens sits 12 mm from the eye, so on the cornea it will have slightly less effect (become weaker). Using the vertex formula F_CL = F_spec / (1 - d * F_spec), with d = 0.012 m and F_spec = -5.00 D, we get F_CL â -4.72 D. The nearest available 0.25 D step is -4.75 D.

We calculate the effective power at the eye using F_CL = F_spec / (1 + d * F_spec) â -5.60 D, rounded to -5.50 D. Using a -5.50 D contact lens will provide the appropriate correction for a -6.00 D spectacle prescription."

        answer: 0,
        explanation: "For -10.00 D: F_CL = -10.00 / (1 + 0.12) â -8.93 D. Rounding to the nearest step gives -9.00 D. Thus, a -10.00 D glasses prescription corresponds to roughly -9.00 D in a contact lens."
