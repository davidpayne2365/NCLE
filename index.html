                    question: "Which layer of the cornea is responsible for most of the cornea's refractive power?",
                    options: [
                        "Epithelium",
                        "Bowman's membrane",

                    ],
                    answer: 0,
                    explanation: "The epithelium is the anterior (front) layer of the cornea and provides about two-thirds of the cornea's total refractive power. This is important for contact lens fitting as lenses rest on this layer, and any epithelial damage can affect vision and lens comfort."
                },
                {
                    question: "What is the average horizontal visible iris diameter (HVID) in adults?",

                        "8.0 mm",
                        "10.0 mm",

                    ],
                    answer: 2,
                    explanation: "The average horizontal visible iris diameter (HVID) in adults is around 11.8 mm. This measurement is crucial for selecting the appropriate diameter for contact lenses, especially rigid gas permeable (RGP) lenses."
                },
                {
                    question: "Which of the following is NOT a layer of the tear film?",
                    options: [
                        "Lipid layer",
                        "Aqueous layer",

                        "Protein layer"
                    ],
                    answer: 3,
                    explanation: "The tear film consists of three layers: the lipid (oily) outer layer that prevents evaporation, the aqueous (watery) middle layer that hydrates the cornea, and the mucin inner layer that helps the tear film adhere to the corneal surface. There is no distinct protein layer in the tear film, although proteins are found within the aqueous layer."

                {
                    question: "Which ocular structure produces aqueous humor?",
                    options: [
                        "Iris",
                        "Ciliary body",
                        "Trabecular meshwork",
                        "Lens"
                    ],
                    answer: 1,
                    explanation: "The ciliary body produces aqueous humor, which maintains intraocular pressure and provides nutrients to the lens and cornea. Understanding aqueous humor production and drainage is important when considering patients with glaucoma for contact lens wear."
                },
                {
                    question: "What is the normal corneal thickness at the center?",

                        "0.3 mm",
                        "0.5 mm",

                        "1.0 mm"
                    ],
                    answer: 1,
                    explanation: "The normal corneal thickness at the center is approximately 0.5 mm (or 500 microns). Corneal thickness is an important measurement when evaluating patients for certain types of contact lenses, especially in patients with conditions like keratoconus."
                },

                    question: "Which condition is characterized by corneal thinning and steepening that results in an irregular, cone-shaped cornea?",
